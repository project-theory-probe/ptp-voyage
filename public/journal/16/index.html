      <h2>THE ARCHITECTURE OF INTIMACY</h2>
      <h3>Intimacy: A Site of Danger or Protection?</h3>
      <span class="author">Kitty Gia Ngân</span>
      <article lang="en" class="multicolumn-large">
        <p>In 1982, Gilligan and Pollak conducted studies using the TAT (Thematic Apperception Test) to analyze subconscious narratives of 138 college students. Their research found that when men were shown an image of a peaceful couple by a river, over 20% imagined violence—murder, kidnapping, or betrayal. Not a single woman did. Instead, women perceived danger in images depicting success, where a person stands alone. This suggests a tendency for masculine-coded perspectives to perceive relationships as threats, whereas feminine-coded perspectives experience separation and individualist achievement as danger.</p>
        <p>Although the study meant to point out sex difference in subconscious narration which determined how we perceive self and others, rather than using the binary terms "men" and "women," which easily reinforce dichotomies and biological determinism, I will instead use <b>feminine—masculine</b> as a spectrum, acknowledging that both (and other) exist within every individual.</p>
        <p>What I want to emphasize here is that there is an ontological difference, and this difference determined whether a person perceives danger or safety in intimacy, thus, the strategies that such individual will adopt.</p>
      </article>
      <article>
        <p>In <a href="https://ptp.voyage/journal/15/#thearchitectureofintimacy">journal 15</a>, I wrote about In/Visibility as a site of Resistance, Negotiation, and Care within the Architecture of Intimacy. But such a statement comes from an assumption of ontology where intimacy is a site of safety rather than danger. In the world we are living in, the contrary may be the dominant narrative in many societies, where intimacy (i.e. connectedness and care) is a site of danger, and separation (i.e. autonomy and boundary) is our protection.</p>
        <p><b>Is intimacy a site of danger or protection?</b> I will discuss this question through the lenses of:</p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Epistemic in/visibility</li>
          <li>Ontological in/visibility</li>
          <li>Generational in/visibility</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Thus, offering the first patterns for intimacy.</p>

        <h2>Epistemic In/visibility</h2>
        <h3>Developmental Psychology: Is Identity Shaped by Separation or Affiliation?</h3>
        <p>The <b>normative psychological development model</b>, where identity is formed through separation, is deeply rooted in Western, masculine-coded developmental theories that emphasize <b>individuation, autonomy, and differentiation</b> as the primary markers of maturity. Foundational figures such as Erik Erikson (Psychosocial Development: Identity vs. Role Confusion), Sigmund Freud (Psychosexual Development: Oedipal Complex), Jean Piaget (Cognitive Development: Formal Operational Stage), and Lawrence Kohlberg (Moral Development: Principle-Based Ethics) have shaped this framework. Within this model, <b>the self is measured against a hierarchical ordering of relationships</b>—progress is determined by one’s ability to separate from others and assert individuality.</p>
        <p>In contrast, Carol Gilligan brought up how feminine-coded perspective emphasizes <b>relational identity</b>, where selfhood is formed not through separation but through interconnectedness. Rather than a hierarchical structure, identity emerges within <b>a web of relationships</b>—a dynamic interplay of care, responsibility, and interdependence.</p>
        <p>Gilligan, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_a_Different_Voice">In a Different Voice</a>, critiques the assumption that identity must be established through separation. She highlights how feminine-coded developmental psychology follows a path of <b>relations, care, and response-ability</b> rather than individuation. A young feminine-coded body, for example, may describe their identity not through markers of separation (“I was born in… I am this… I believe in that…”) but through markers of relation and care (“I am a daughter of... I want to help people with…”).</p>
        <p>However, within the dominant framework, this mode of development is often misunderstood as a "fusion of identity with others," leading to the perception that it represents <b>weaker selfhood, inferior boundaries, diminished autonomy and morality</b>. This epistemic bias results in the erasure of relational models of identity across institutions like school, corporate, and law, reinforcing a hierarchical structure where relational ways of knowing and being are seen as underdeveloped.</p>
        <p>Even to this date, the masculine-coded perspectives continue to be treated as the universal model for human psychological development. Major figures in the field of developmental psychology—Kohlberg, Piaget, Vaillant, Erikson—have established it as the “norm,” shaping literature, media, folklore, and historical archives. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/teach/articles/zjf4y9q">The Buddha’s story</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey">the Hero’s Journey</a> are prime examples. Mind us, these narratives are <b>neither wrong nor incomplete</b>, but they simply <b>do not represent universality</b>. They should not be the standard reference point for all ontologies, as this renders all other developmental paths "deviant" or inferior when they diverge from the dominant framework.</p>

        <h2>Ontological Invisibility</h2>
        <p>Gilligan (1982) recognized another kind of morality & identity-formation—one framed not by separation but by <b>an ontology of relations and interconnectedness.</b></p>
