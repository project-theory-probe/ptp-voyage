      <h2>THE ARCHITECTURE OF INTIMACY</h2>
      <h3>Intimacy: A Site of Danger or Protection?</h3>
      <span class="author">Kitty Gia Ngân</span>
      <article lang="en" class="multicolumn-large">
        <p>In 1982, Gilligan and Pollak <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325699128_Images_of_violence_in_Thematic_Apperception_Test_stories">conducted studies</a> using the TAT (Thematic Apperception Test) to analyze subconscious narratives of 138 college students. Their research found that when men were shown an image of a peaceful couple by a river, over 20% imagined violence—murder, kidnapping, or betrayal. Not a single woman did. Instead, women perceived danger in images depicting success, where a person stands alone. This suggests a tendency for masculine-coded perspectives to perceive relationships as threats, whereas feminine-coded perspectives experience separation and individualist achievement as danger.</p>
        <img src="assets/TAT_Danger.png" alt="Danger in Affiliation: Male 26% - Female 0%, Danger in Achievement: Male 1% - Female 12%">
        <p>Rather than debating on sex difference, what I want to emphasize here is that there are <b>ontological differences</b> which determine whether a person perceives danger or safety in intimacy, thus, the strategies that such individual will adopt in life.</p>

      <article>
        <p>In <a href="https://ptp.voyage/journal/15/#thearchitectureofintimacy">journal 15</a>, I wrote about In/Visibility as a site of Resistance, Negotiation, and Care within the Architecture of Intimacy. But such a statement comes from an assumption of ontology where intimacy is a site of safety rather than danger. In the world we are living in, the contrary may be the dominant narrative in many societies, where intimacy (i.e. connectedness and care) is a site of danger, and separation (i.e. autonomy and boundary) is our protection.</p>
        <p><b>Is intimacy a site of danger or protection?</b> I will discuss this question through the lenses of:</p>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>Epistemic In/Visibility</li>
          <li>Ontological In/Visibility</li>
          <li>Generational In/Visibility</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Thus, offering the first patterns for intimacy.</p>

        <h3>1. EPISTEMIC INVISIBILITY</h3>
        <h4>Sociopsycho Development: Maturity Through Separation or Affiliation?</h4>
      </article>
      <article lang="en" class="multicolumn-large">
        <p>The <b>normative sociopsycho development model</b>—rooted in Western, masculine-coded theories—emphasizes <b>individuation, autonomy, and differentiation</b> as markers of maturity. Figures like Erik Erikson, Sigmund Freud, Jean Piaget, and Lawrence Kohlberg shaped this framework, where selfhood is measured by one's ability to separate from others and each relationship is placed within a hierarchical order. (Theme: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decolonization_of_knowledge">decolonization</a>)</p>
        <p>Within a hierarchical ordering, relationships are placed within the zero-sum game, making intimacy more likely to be a site of danger & competition rather than safety & support.</p>
        <img src="public/journal/16/assets/danger_or_safety.png">
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carol_Gilligan">Carol Gilligan</a> critiqued this assumption of universality, recognizing another <b>model of identity</b> that's based on <b>relations, care, interdependence, and response-ability</b> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_a_Different_Voice">In a Different Voice, 1982</a>). Instead of defining selfhood through separation of one's ego, a relational perspective frames identity through relationships—not as a hierarchy, but as an <b>interconnected web</b> that extends to the margins.</p>
        <p>However, <b>dominant psychology misinterprets relational identity as weaker selfhood, thus, morality</b>, reinforcing a bias that devalues relational ways of knowing in institutions like school, corporate structures, and law. The <b>masculine-coded model</b> remains the standard, shaping literature, media, and historical narratives, such as the Buddha’s story and the Hero’s Journey. While valid, they don’t represent universal developmental experiences, and treating them as such renders alternative developmental paths "deviant" or inferior.</p>

        <h3>2. ONTOLOGICAL INVISIBILITY</h3>
        <h4>When Voice = Relationships = Morality.</h4>
      </article>
      <article>
        <p>Gilligan (1982) recognized an alternative mode of identity formation and morality—one rooted not in separation but in an <b>ontology of relations and interconnectedness</b>. Within this framework, morality is not a system of judging right and wrong (like how it has been defined in normative models) but as an <b>awareness of connection and responsibility:</b></p>
        <blockquote>
          "<i>Her world is a world of relationships and psychological truths where an awareness of the connection between people gives rise to a recognition of responsibility for one another, a perception of the need for response.</i>" (Gilligan, 1982)
        </blockquote>
        <p>Since morality is based on relations, <b>self-invisibility</b> (losing one’s voice) means <b>disappearing from relationships thus refusing both relational morality and responsibility</b>:</p>
        <blockquote>
          "<i>To give up their voice is to give up on relationship and also to give up all that goes with making a choice.</i>" (Gilligan, 1982)
        </blockquote>
        <h4>Choosing Unvoice = No Relationship = Relational Immorality.</h4>
        <img src="public/journal/16/assets/web_identity_morality.png" alt="Awareness of Web -> Relational-Based Identity -> Care-Based Morality">
        <blockquote>
          "<i>To have a voice is to be human. To have something to say is to be a person. But speaking depends on listening and being heard; it is an intensely relational act.</i>" (Gilligan, 1993)
        </blockquote>
        <p>Although <b>self-invisibility blocks intimacy & relationality</b>, historically, when unheard (e.g. discrimination, persecution, being neglected & dismissed), many would choose an "illusory intimacy" at the cost of voice. Invisibility becomes a survival strategy. Techniques like dissociation, masking, and self-erasure—whether emotionally, physically, or socially—serve as protective mechanisms in navigating hostile environments.</p>
        <p>The illusion of intimacy/relationship is a kind of "shame-based intimacy"—where connection is forged NOT out of genuine mutuality, but out of a fear of abandonment and an inability to see oneself clearly. As the result, erasing a whole person/ontology.</p>

      <h3>3. GENERATIONAL INVISIBILITY</h3>
      <h4>The Legacy of Silence: How Invisibility Shapes Knowledge and Generativity</h4>
      </article>
      <article lang="en" class="multicolumn-large">
        <p>When a survival strategy of invisibility is passed down through generations due to histories of domination, war, and <b>systemic oppression</b>, it extends into what I call <b>generational invisibility</b>.</p>
        <p>In terms of sociopsycho development on a generational scale, I want to introduce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood_and_Society">Erikson (1950)</a>’s concept of <b>generativity</b>: A person's willingness to contribute to future generations through care and responsibility is called "generativity", which is a form of <b>knowledge transmission</b> and generational meaning-making. <a href="https://archive.org/details/towardnewpsychol00jean_0/mode/2up">Jean Baker Miller (1976)</a> expands on this by framing <b>care as the bridge between survival and generativity</b>.</p>
        <img src="Survival_or_Generative.png" alt="Survival Mode -> if (+) care -> Generative Mode">
        <p>However, when there is a generational invisibility, generative epistemic development is disrupted, creating a fragmented knowledge system that cannot integrate all patterns of knowing: <a href="https://nursology.net/patterns-of-knowing-in-nursing/empiric-knowing/">Empirical Knowing</a> (factual), <a href="https://nursology.net/patterns-of-knowing-in-nursing/personal-knowing/">Personal Knowing</a> (from self-understanding & empathy), <a href="https://nursology.net/patterns-of-knowing-in-nursing/ethical-knowing/">Ethical Knowing</a> (morality), <a href="https://nursology.net/patterns-of-knowing-in-nursing/aesthetic-knowing/">Aesthetic Knowing</a> (awareness of the here & now) (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carper%27s_fundamental_ways_of_knowing">Carper, 1978</a>), and <a href="https://nursology.net/patterns-of-knowing-in-nursing/emancipatory-knowing/">Emancipatory Knowing</a> (critical awareness of power, oppression, and social justice) (Chinn & Kramer).</p>
        <p>Over time, suppressed histories and silenced identities create generational epistemic gaps, where the inability to recognize or trust one’s own knowledge limits the capacity for history-making, truth-seeing, thus, change. Without visibility, truth remains inaccessible; without truth, generativity is stifled—leaving only survival in its place.</p>
      </article>
      <hr width="100%" size="2">
      <article>
      <h3>Generative Framework within Web-Based Ontology</h3>
        <p>Recognizing that epistemic, ontological, and generational visibility shape our capacity for connection, alongside identity, knowledge, and generativity, we must move beyond fragmented experiences of intimacy toward a systemic framework: an Architecture of Intimacy that actively promotes safety of voice (ie. visibility), thus sustaining diverse ontologies and multitudes of truth.</p>
        <p>To conclude, my proposal for the first <a href="https://ptp.voyage/journal/13/#thearchitectureofintimacy">patterns of intimacy</a> are:</p>
          <ol type="1">
            <li>Epistemic Visibility</li>
            <li>Ontological Visibility</li>
            <li>Generational Visibility</li>
          </ol>
        <p>Since intimacy within the web-based ontology is a new vision with a lack of existing discourses, seeking for patterns of its architecture in realworld spaces remains an exploration. But a meaningful and worthwhile one.</p>

      <h2>WHAT’S LOVE* GOT TO DO WITH IT?</h2>
      <h3>Queer Manifesto of Love</h3>
      <span class="author">Kitty Gia Ngân</span>
      <article lang="en" class="multicolumn-large">
        <p>I first had a desire to create a futuristic manifesto of love, written from the future and drifted to the past which is our present. The reader will have to use a dice to read/play it. The manifesto has rituals, prompts, and a role-playing mechanism. Of course, it will be written in, passed on from person to person, group to group. As a living document, it will never be completed or finished, always changing and expanding. That's how I understand the queer-inclusion world and what it is to be a manifesto.</p>
        <p>When people talk about love (usually in gossip), I see that people tune-in when "love" is personal and comforting. But when "love" is stretched beyond the personal bubble, or that it requires confrontation, disruption, and uncomfortable witnessing, people quickly tune-out and pull-away. Yet, the practice of love demands all of the above. The personal merges with the political and they entangle, spill over one another.</p>
        <p>I used bell hooks' essay, <a href="https://blackcommunityhamburg.blackblogs.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/920/2020/10/bell-hooks-Love-as-the-Practice-of-Freedom.pdf">Love As the Practice of Freedom</a> as the foundation for the manifesto zine. I think this zine is not for the faint of heart... Nor is any serious study on love/intimacy suitable for spaces with a lack of courage. Because such a subject matter is deeply piercing: It requires us to face ourselves, continuously and deeply. I hope the manifesto gives people an immersive, participatory, and evolving experience of such a love; That is, only if they actually participate.</p>
