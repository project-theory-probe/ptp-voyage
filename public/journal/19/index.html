      <h2>THE ARCHITECTURE OF INTIMACY</h2>
      <span class="author">Kitty Gia Ngân</span>
      <article lang="en" class="multicolumn-super-large">
        <section>
          <p><strong>In <a href="https://ptp.voyage/journal/18/#thearchitectureofintimacy">Journal 18</a>, departing from the Interpersonal Model of Intimacy, we arrived at the Diffractive Model of Intimacy.</strong></p>
          <p>The Interpersonal Model defines a relationship as a bond between two discrete subjects, usually human-to-human, or human-to-pet. The health of the relationship is the question of personality, which is then disciplined through self-development. This model is embedded in the ontology of (separated) being. Although useful, we now depart this shore of the interpersonal to arrive at the diffractive, embedded in the ontology of (relational) becoming. Not deployed the two as a dichotomy, but showcasing the diversity in ontologies.</p>
          <p>In this article, I write about perception and time in the ontology of becoming, which I found to be important layers for us to understand the Diffractive Model of Intimacy.</p>
          <hr>
          <h3><em>The fluidity of perception</em></h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>You are late. Your footsteps are hurrying from the office through an ocean of people flooding on the street to get to an appointed restaurant. In this complex ebb and flow, thicker and thinner, faster and slower, of bodies, movements, and changing landscapes, your perception focuses on the temporary openings ahead, where one to another leads you closer to the restaurant, not narrowing down onto any <em>thing</em> in particular. That opening is not a hole. Rather, it is an expression of how “everything in the field (your environment), moving and still, integrally relates at that instant” (M&amp;M, 83), these expressions are called <em>a field effect</em>.</p>
              <p>In this mode of moving and perceiving, everything is attended in the same way—to move forward, you need to be at one with the environment and commit to unhierarchy. This is the mode of environmental awareness, a usually peripheral mode of perception which now gets to come to the front. This experience is textured with movements, complexly patterned with change and transition, teemingly differentiated, interweaved.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Once you walk inside the appointed restaurant, you recognize your family members in the far corner. Their distinct faces, voices, forms, gestures, habits pop out. Greeting each of them discretely, you return to the usual subtractive mode of awareness. You sit next to your partner (whom you feel the most comfortable with in comparison to the rest of the group), and your perception is now collaborating with hierarchical thoughts and things, no longer in the realm of unthinking, non-hierarchical movements.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3><em>Introducing: Environmental awareness &amp; Subtractive awareness</em></h3>
          <p>These two modes of perception—environmental versus subtractive—are polarities within a spectrum. The distinction is not deployed as a dichotomy, but notions that make visible differing modes of being while honoring their fluidity. Each mode of perception on the spectrum is a differing mode of existence—all equally valid.</p>
          <p><img src="awareness-spectrum-line.png" /><span class="credit>The continuum of awareness, proposed by Manning and Massumi.</p>
          <p>These two polarities remind me of the Law of Indeterminacy in quantum field theory, where an atom can be known either in its position OR its movement, but not both position AND movement at the same time. The apparatuses that measure the atom’s position or movement are mutually exclusive.</p>
          <p>When it comes to perception, we can be in the mode of environmental awareness, where we are at one with all things around us—forming a dance of attentiveness that transcends the subject-and-object binary. Alternatively, we can be in the mode of subtractive awareness, where the subject of observation comes to the front with affordances, positions, and boundaries. This latter mode of discernment allows effective future-planning, goal achievement, boundary-drawing, and scalable projects.</p>
          <p><img src="assets/awareness-spectrum.png" /><span class="credit">Inspired by Circuit Lab's <a href="https://experimental.run/">Approach to Insight</a>, which then I proposed <a href="https://ptp.voyage/journal/14/#thearchitectureofintimacy">in light of intimacy</a> and now perception.</span></p>
          <p>The two ends of the spectrum are available to everybody. There are no exclusive zones that is reserved for a specific “brain-type”. It is more a matter of situation, preference, tendencies, agitations—not predetermined or fixed traits. Anyone can swing seamlessly between environmental and subtractive, back-and-fro, but the pace and rhythm to which they do so is conditional and individuated.</p>
          <p>I do think, though, it is sad that in the neurotypical world of today, we willfully undermine the mode of environmental awareness as immature, illogical, fantastical, or even unreal. We can now observe the destructive effects of collectively abandoning a mode of becoming and worlding that allows us to feel entangled, mesmerized with the larger universe.</p>
          <blockquote>
            But you were thinking, with your movement. Your every movement was a performed analysis of the field’s composition from the angle of its affordance for getting-ahead. Entering the dance of attention, your perceiving converged with your moving activity, and your activity was your thinking. You entered a mode of environmental awareness in which to perceive is to enact thought, and thought is directly relational. This actively relational thinking is also an expression of the field, but in a different mode than story-telling, poetic or not, with no immediate need for language, satisfying itself at a level with the body’s movements: integrally embodied expression. (Manning and Massumi, 2013)
          </blockquote>
          <p>Within this mode of perception is the angle to which we understand the Diffractive Mode of Intimacy:</p>
          <table border="1">
            <thead>
              <tr><th><strong>Diffractive Mode of Intimacy</strong></th></tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr><td>Indeterminate entities, whose positions momentarily emerge through diffraction and intra-action within time-space-mattering, co-constitute and co-create worlds.</td></tr>
              <tr><td>1. Indeterminate (not essentialist)</td></tr>
              <tr><td>2. Performative (not Reflexive or Representationalist)</td></tr>
              <tr><td>3. Entangled (not Binary)</td></tr>
              <tr><td>4. Diffractive Mode of Analysis</td></tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>
          <h3><em>Ontology in environmental awareness</em></h3>
          <p>Autistic people are frequently in the mode of environmental awareness, where life unfolds moment to moment without a subtractive hierarchy that is usually helpful for discernment and goal achievement. Yet many patterns attributed to “autism” also appear in celebrated thinkers—from Albert Einstein, Niklas Luhmann, to Emily Dickinson, Virginia Woolf, and Shakyamuni Buddha—figures who are often described as having attained an “enlightened” mode of perception, a rather <em>extraordinary sensitivity</em>.</p>
          <p>Contrary to previous misconceptions that assume autists lack empathy or deny relations, recent studies show a heightened, non-hierarchical capacity for relation. Environmental awareness allows humans to live within a relational mode that transcends normative topography—moving toward terrains of the more-than-human, where the whole world interweaves in a non-hierarchical network of livinghood.</p>
          <blockquote>
            “There was very little difference in meaning between the children next to the lake that I was playing with and the turtle sitting on the log. It seems that when most people think of something being alive they really mean, human.”  
            <em>(Daina Krumins, quoted in <em>Miller, Women From Another Planet</em>, p. 23–89)</em>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            “I hear the rocks and the trees.”  
            <em>(MM, quoted in <em>Miller, Women from Another Planet</em>, p. 54)</em>
          </blockquote>
          <p>Diffracting across disciplines, I find similar patterns in affect theory, actor-network theory, process-relational philosophy, agential realism, quantum physics, ethnography, and so on. I propose that these schools of thought are all perceiving life through environmental awareness.</p>
          <p>For example, Deleuze and Guattari suggest that an organism is a community of heterogeneous lifeforms coexisting symbiotically—indeterminate, moving as one without a hierarchy. This contrasts with popular evolutionary theories that view species through function and form (i.e., subtractive perception), where individuals compete to be the fittest. They write, “modes of individuation precede the subject or the organism,” where <em>becoming</em> involves neither forms nor subjects. “It is the domain of symbiosis that brings into play beings of totally different scales and kingdoms.” In contrast to evolution, they call this form of change between heterogeneous terms <em>involution</em>. (<em>A Thousand Plateaus</em>)</p>
          <p>Returning to the question of intimacy: just as moving through an ocean of people, or being immersed in a dance, a project, an intimate moment, we become without a self, or non-self-consciousness. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi famously called this “flow.” It is a state of environmental awareness.</p>
          <p>When we are in environmental awareness, we see that everything is changing from one moment to another without a permanent position. There is no fixed goal like a marathon; instead, it is a playful, indeterminate swim around a calm lake. The whole world looks different and feels different in such an ontology. The boundary between “I” and “we,” “self” and “environment” dissolves, for entanglement is lived. And in that moment, we are experiencing <em>intimacy</em>.</p>
