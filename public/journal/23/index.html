      <h2>THE ARCHITECTURE OF INTIMACY</h2>
      <h3>Friendship as the Technology of Intimacy</h3>
      <span class="author">Kitty Gia Ngân</span>
      <article lang="en" class="multicolumn-large">
        <p>To talk about friendship, we must first deconstruct what we mean by <em>friendship</em>. Each word carries historicity, embedded expectations, and associations—shaped largely by dominant systems such as the economy and capitalism. Yet the word “friendship” is multifold. Let me explain with the following exercise.</p>
      <h3>The Relationship Map</h3>
        <p>This exercise was brought to my attention by Tim Fletcher. It goes like this:</p>
        <p>Take a piece of paper and draw four circles, like in this image. Think about the people in your life and place them in the circle that feels right:</p>
        <img src="relationshipmap.jpg" alt="Relationship Map with 4 circles">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Acquaintance</strong>: You know their name, you can talk about safe topics (news, job, kids). Only experience happy and positive emotions here. You may have hundreds or even thousands of acquaintances.</li>
          <li><strong>Casual friends</strong>: People you enjoy doing something with, where emotions are mostly fun and happy.</li>
          <li><strong>Close friends</strong>: People you enjoy simply being with. You can talk about more “dangerous” topics—deep personal struggles, beliefs, values. They don’t judge or try to fix you.</li>
          <li><strong>Soulmates</strong>: No secrets, total openness. The deepest sharing of vulnerability, struggle, and intimacy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>According to Fletcher, people often map friendships based on history, time spent, shared activities, or frequency of contact and how much fun they had. But this kind of placement puts people at risk of being in unhealthy relationships. Instead, he suggests asking these for each relationship: “Am I totally safe? Am I totally accepted? Can I talk about every topic important to me and share every emotion? Will I receive understanding? Or will they judge and try to fix me? Will they share also at that level?”</p>
        <p>This shift often reveals that people who are <em>supposed</em> to be close—parents, siblings, spouses, buddies—may not actually fall in the “Close Friends” circle. For many, life is filled mostly with “casual friends,” leaving the deeper circles nearly empty.</p>
        <p>Friendship—in terms of becoming intimacy, not beingness—is where we learn, work through, and reimagine the social fabric of our lives.</p>
      <h2>The Friends versus Family Problem</h2>
        <p>Usually, friends and family are pitched against each other: once family begins, friends fade into the background. Classic colonial anthropology studied kinship using such binaries, which further created widespread biases that are rooted in racist notions of hierarchy and lineage.</p>
        <p>The nuclear family is not a natural form of kinship but a carefully engineered invention of the colonial-capitalist state. It privatises care by shifting full responsibility onto individuals, isolating them within households, and dismantling wider systems of social support. This restructuring is enforced through racism, sexism, classism, ableism and so on while simultaneously lengthening work hours, cutting welfare, and shrinking public care infrastructure as people are funneled into factories and corporate labor.</p>
        <p>“The historical advent of the white bourgeois family was concurrent with violent erasure of other forms of kinship.” (<a href="https://lighthousebookshop.com/events/friends-in-common-forster-and-white-on-radical-friendship-and-everyday-solidarities">Forster and White</a>) Erasure of historicity from communal living, to queer and non-heteronormative bonds, indigenous kins, and mutual aid practices. To take friendship seriously is to reimagine intimacy beyond the whitewashed picture of <em>family</em> and address the imposed scarcity of care under capitalism.</p>
        <p>"For us, it is <em>within and through</em> such practices that new and unknown forms of anti-capitalist sociality can be imagined and struggled towards." (Forster and White)</p>
        <p>I dare say to be attentive to the geographies of connection is a radical practice. This practice would lead us farther away from the machine. Because it forces us to challenge what dominant science, education, politics, and media have fed us as “truth.”</p>
        <p>To confront our intimate life is much scarier than critiquing abstract systems. It requires us to interrogate how we love, whom we trust, and what forms of love we accept as possible. It destabilizes the very ground of subjectivity.</p>
      <h2>Friending</h2>
        <p><em>Friending</em> is not to find echo chambers of people who are already like us, but becoming more complex, wider, more porous and capable together. Becoming friends teaches us the forms of life not totally captured by capitalism. In refusing to settle on established, hierarchical, normative notions of family and friend, we start to imagine new kinds of sociality and possible worlds.</p>
        <p>I love how Nho put it in a podcast about true friendship:</p>
        <p>“I come full, I come undefended, I come raw. And that’s what I mean by freedom. I don’t have to protect who I am, I don’t have to perform anything anymore, I get to be in the presence of my friend and my friend will tell me everything exactly as it is.” (Nho, <a href="https://youtu.be/uDNkmlQ6H1M?si=22ugtoLNoteBMqra">Spiritual Friendships</a>)</p>      
        <p>In <em>Friends In Common</em>, Laura C. Forster and Joel White wrote, <em>friendship as both a political act in itself - a commitment to forming intimacies despite the individualising and apathy-inducing capitalist machine - and as a key sustaining force within political struggles of various kinds.</em></p>
        <p>Throughout <em>The Architecture of Intimacy</em> series, I hope readers have come to see that intimacy is not about <em>being close to a person</em>, but intimacy is better understood as an <em>experience</em> that grows the seed of entanglement within and through us.</p>
        <p>This phenomenon happens within a parameter—conditions shaped by larger systems (economy, education, politics, media) intra-acting with what’s generated <em>within and through</em> us. Dense bonds—what some traditions call spiritual friendships—participate strongly in such parameters. They allow us to experience entanglement repeatedly, at a frequency and duration that enable us to live more in the reality of care, interdependence, freedom, than out of fear, isolation, and confinement.</p>
