      <h2>THE ARCHITECTURE OF INTIMACY</h2>
      <h3>In-Visibility and In/Visibility: Toward a Practice of Relational Embodiment</h3>
      <span class="author">Kitty Gia Ngân</span>
      <article lang="en">
        <p>Laying the foundations to talk about intimacy, <a href="https://ptp.voyage/journal/14/#thearchitectureofintimacy">my last article</a> introduced some bio-psychological basis like neural entrainment in emotional dialogues. Before exploring the Architecture of Intimacy itself, I want to start with the material that forms it. This material, I propose, is our ability to see—or what I call <i>in-visibility</i> and <i>in/visibility</i>.</p>
      <h3>From Hanging-Out to Research and Resistance</h3>
        <p>From my teenage years, I developed a peculiar interest in going around the city and talking to strangers. The habit started when I had to take long bus rides across town to set up a classroom for underserved children with a former teacher. Through repetition, I stumbled upon ways to engage in deep and genuine dialogues with many strangers.</p>
        <p>This random skill became a methodology during my first year of college. I was sent to Japan for an honorary research amongst students who were my seniors, thus, I received little instructions on how to conduct an interview. I then improvised my own approach for immersive observation, which translated to… hanging-out with my “subjects” and being friends. Formal interviews felt too insensitive for me. I later learned that anthropologists also do not “conduct interviews”, they instead “hang-out deeply” and develop genuine connections with the communities they study, moving away from the exploitative and transactional nature of traditional social research. Within 20 minutes of learning this, I sent a letter to the university and switched my major to Anthropology.</p>
      <h4>Practice seeing</h4>
        <p>Being a social human means <i>always</i> navigating hierarchical implications in social interactions.</p>
        <p>For example, in a formal interview, the power dynamic favors the interviewer, who is in control and extracts knowledge without reciprocity. The interviewer remains hidden (invisible) while inquiring exposure (visibility) from the interviewee. To resist this implication of power which naturally creates dis/empowerment, it does not help by pretending that the hierarchy and biases don’t exist. We must make the biases known (acknowledged by both) and actively work towards a place of mutual engagement. The ethics of care, then, becomes an active practice, where one is always resisting and negotiating consciously the status-quo.</p>
        <p>The heart of today’s anthropological practice is this intentional practice of care, acknowledging the exploitative culture of our current social interactions. We reach insight through embodied and lived knowledge, not “studied” from an “objective”, outsider’s point-of-view. In other words, anthropologists practice <b>seeing people as they see themselves</b> (stepping in their visibility), rather than imposing an outsider’s framework.</p>
      <h3>In-Visibility and In/Visibility as sites of negotiation, resistance, and care.</h3>
        <p><i>In-Visibility</i> is the process of stepping into visibility—of being seen, transparent, conscious, awake, alive. To be in-visibility is to enter and inhabit the space of being seen while also revealing what has been unseen within yourself and others.</p>
        <p><i>In/Visibility</i> is the fluid state of being seen/unseen, recognizing that visibility is not absolute but rather shifting and dependent on power, perception, and agency.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The slash ( / ) in In/Visibility follows the logic of Dis/Ability in Crip Theory and Critical Disability Theory, marking the tension between being seen and remaining unseen, showing that these states are interconnected and fluid rather than separate or fixed. In/visibility disrupts the assumption that visibility and invisibility are opposites or mutually exclusive.</li>
          <li>Some forms of visibility come with power and recognition, while others come with surveillance, scrutiny, or negative vulnerability. To be in/visible is to navigate this terrain intentionally. The emphasis on agency of participating actors: Who gets to be seen and unseen? Who gets to see?  Who gets to decide the meaning of what they see?</li>
          <li>Just as dis/ability reveals how society determines who is considered able or disabled, in/visibility asks: Who gets to be seen? Who is rendered invisible? What does it mean to take control of one's visibility?</li>
        </ul>
      <h4>Who gets to be desired? Who gets to be unseen? Who dictates the meanings of what they see?</h4>
        <p>When we resist the hierarchy which pre-exists in all social interactions, essentially, we are practicing seeing: 1) We practice seeing another person for who they see themselves. 2) We practice co-creating a site where others can easily see and reveal themselves. 3) We practice spotting our existing biases, thus, no longer being distorted by them. Keeping a connection transparent is active– it is labor, and is the foundation of the Ar(t)chitecture of Intimacy.</p>
