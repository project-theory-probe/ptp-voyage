      <h2>THE ARCHITECTURE OF INTIMACY</h2>
      <span class="author">Kitty Gia Ngân</span>
      <article lang="en" class="multicolumn-large">
        <h3>Solving societal problems with agential cuts.</h3>
        <p>
          Niklas Luhmann explains how from a sociological angle, intimacy is its own system as it solves the threshold problem of communicating personal details within a society structured by impersonal systems. Intimacy is a communication system that uses the symbol of “love” to enable the sharing of individualized information. This solves what he calls the “threshold problem of love”: how to set one relationship apart from all others in a society that increasingly operates through generalized, impersonal codes. Intimacy becomes the space where individuality can be communicated, where someone becomes more than a role or function. It allows for emotional resonance and mutual recognition in a system otherwise geared toward abstraction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Language is one of the best ways we draw and redraw these cuts. But often, language is mistaken to fossilize life. Communication must remain alive—repetitive, contextual, and ongoing—because the only constant is impermanence and change. To say “I love you” now is to cut again, to reaffirm and reconfigure the relation anew.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the foundation of this series lies a premise: entanglement—not separateness—is the fundamental condition of the world. There is no pre-existing distinction between self and other, subject and object, observer and observed. These separations are momentary enactments we perform, often unconsciously, in order to function in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Karen Barad calls these enactments "agential cuts"—situated and temporary distinctions made within entanglement. An agential cut does not sever relationships; it reconfigures it. Every cut is world-making. It shapes what and who gets to matter, what is included and excluded, what futures become possible. Agential cut is an on-going ethical choice that everyone has to make. It reconfigures the world through a specific enactment of separability without denying the deeper relationality. We must take responsibility for the boundaries and meanings we help produce. To live ethically is to become attuned to the patterns of entanglement we’re already a part of—and to take responsibility for the boundaries (or lack of boundaries) we enact within them.
        </p>
        <p>
          This understanding runs counter to many societal misunderstandings, especially the idea of a permanent self. We often relate to ourselves and others as if we are stable, fixed entities that can be fully known, catalogued, and archived. But no river is ever the same twice. No human is either. The self is a choreography of cuts—of partial, shifting, contextual enactments. If there is no permanent self—only entangled becomings—then intimacy must also be a practice of continual re-cutting, re-knowing, re-configuring. You cannot fully know someone, marry them, and call it done. There is no final revelation of the self. There is only the ongoing risk of being known again.
        </p>
        <p>
          This risk is central. Intimacy, like creativity, involves asymmetry and exposure. It requires that we allow ourselves to be affected by another, and that we affect them in return. The balance is not always equal. But for intimacy to be ethical and alive, the risk must be shared, and the cuts must be renewed with care.
        </p>
        <p>
          From this perspective, setting boundaries is not a rejection of intimacy, but a vital part of its architecture. To say, “This version of us is no longer sustainable,” is not to deny the connection, but to reshape it in response to shifting conditions. It’s a refusal to remain complicit in patterns that harm, and a reclamation of one’s agency in world-making. As Barad might say, it’s a reconfiguration of matter and meaning, an ethical intervention in the flow of becoming.
        </p>
        <p>
          Assemblage theory deepens this understanding further. A revolution in relationship—whether romantic, political, or personal—is not sustained by a single rupture. It must be followed by new compositions: new codes, rituals, and environments that resist capture by dominant structures. This applies equally to intimacy. Love, too, can become rigid or hierarchical. It can be absorbed into systems of control or exploitation. To keep it alive, it must remain an ongoing experiment in relationality, one that sustains new rhythms of care, consent, and mutual transformation.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this way, intimacy is not the soft margin of life—it is one of its most radical sites of invention. It is where we rewire the codes of the self and the social. It is where we cut again, not to sever, but to begin anew.

      <h2>WHAT’S LOVE* GOT TO DO WITH IT?</h2>
      <span class="author">Kitty Gia Ngân</span>
      <h3></h3>
      <article lang="en" class="multicolumn-super-large">
        <p>
          This month's <b>What's Love* Got To Do</b> series covers the topic, <b><a href="assets/30-ways.pdf" download>Ways to make a conversation feel more alive</a></b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Language is humanity’s greatest tools for disclosure and building bonds. Yet, many of our daily conversations are dull. Let’s call these "zombie conversations"—they are corpses of what’s no longer alive. This booklet shares simple tips that preserve a conversation’s living soul. The art of engaging in life-affirming conversations is a continual practice and craft—one that certainly enriches every life it touches.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through the zine, you will get to see that conversing is truly an act of love — it calls for mindfulness, attentiveness, kindness, insight, and practice. Each conversation holds the potential to be a gift — one that gently renews our aliveness, together.
